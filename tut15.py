# # Python Set

# Tuples and Lists: Key Similarities
# They both hold collections of items and are heterogeneous data types, meaning they can contain multiple data types simultaneously.
# They're both ordered, which implies the items or objects are maintained in the same order as they were placed until changed manually.
# Because they're both sequential data structures, we can iterate through the objects they hold; hence, they are iterables.
# An integer index, enclosed in square brackets [index], can be used to access objects of both data types.
